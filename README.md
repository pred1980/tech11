# Tech 11 Test

1. npm install
2. http://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo -> Request temporary access to the demo server
3. npm run dev

# note:

I implemented the first task as a WebComponent using lit-html and the second one only with lit-html because I wasn't sure if you always implement everything with WebComponents. It works this way too. But we can discuss that later.
